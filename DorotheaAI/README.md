## Project: DorotheaAI

- **Description**: DorotheaAI is a Python-based voice assistant designed to make your life easier by handling various tasks on your computer through voice commands. From controlling YouTube videos to playing music, opening and closing apps, and even having a bit of fun with games like Rock, Paper, Scissors, Dorothea is here to assist you in a way that feels more like interacting with a friend than just another machine.

- **ðŸŒŸ Inspiration**: The idea for DorotheaAI came to me during one of my usual work sessions, where I often listen to music to keep the momentum going. While exploring ideas for creating a voice assistant, I came across the song "Dorothea" by Taylor Swift. The name, meaning "God's gift," sparked the concept of a voice assistant that acts as the perfect gift for someone who works extensively on their laptop, enabling them to complete tasks with just a voice command.
