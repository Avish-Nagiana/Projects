## Project: DorotheaAI

- **Description**: DorotheaAI is a voice assistant project built using Python, with a GUI made on Tkinter. The idea for DorotheaAI came to me while I was listening to the song "Dorothea" by Taylor Swift. üéµ As a habit, I often listen to music while studying or working, and I stumbled upon the basic idea of creating a voice assistant on the internet. I wanted to approach this project differently. The name "Dorothea," meaning "God's gift," inspired me to create a voice assistant that serves as the perfect gift for someone who spends a lot of time on their laptop. üéÅ What better gift than a tool that allows you to perform nearly all tasks with just a voice command?

- **Friend-Like Experience**: To make Dorothea feel more like a friend rather than just a machine, I've added many sarcastic and funny responses. After all, sometimes you just don't want to hear a typical machine script.

- **Features**:
  - **AI-Powered Chatting**: Chat with Dorothea or use AI to create anything with OpenAI integration.
  - **YouTube Control**: Control YouTube videos with commands to resume, pause, mute, unmute, and adjust the volume.
  - **Rock, Paper, Scissors**: Play a fun game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with Dorothea.
  - **App and Website Management**: Open and close various apps and websites through voice commands.
  - **Music Playback**: Play music from your computer‚Äôs music directory using voice commands and stop playback whenever you like.
  - **Task Management**: Ask Dorothea to remember tasks for you and remind you later.
  - **Screenshots**: Take screenshots effortlessly with a voice command.
  - **Search and Information Retrieval**: Use Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube for searching, playing videos, and gathering information.
  - **Calculator**: Perform calculations quickly and easily.
  - **Language Translation**: Translate text into any language you need.
  - **Music Selection by Dorothea**: Let Dorothea surprise you with a song of her choice.
  - **Sleep Mode**: Put Dorothea to sleep with a simple voice command.

- **Technologies Used**: DorotheaAI is primarily built with Python, utilizing the following technologies:
  - **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
  - **SpeechRecognition**: For handling voice commands.
  - **Plyer**: For sending notifications.
  - **Pygame**: For playing music.
  - **OpenAI**: For AI-powered chatting and content creation.
  - **Pillow (PIL)**: For image handling.
