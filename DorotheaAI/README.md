## Project: DorotheaAI

- **Description**: DorotheaAI is a voice assistant project built using Python, with a GUI made on Tkinter. The idea for DorotheaAI came to me while I was listening to the song "Dorothea" by Taylor Swift. üéµ As a habit, I often listen to music while studying or working, and I stumbled upon the basic idea of creating a voice assistant on the internet. I wanted to approach this project differently. The name "Dorothea," meaning "God's gift," inspired me to create a voice assistant that serves as the perfect gift for someone who spends a lot of time on their laptop. üéÅ What better gift than a tool that allows you to perform nearly all tasks with just a voice command?

- **Friend-Like Experience**: To make Dorothea feel more like a friend rather than just a machine, I've added many sarcastic and funny responses. After all, sometimes you just don't want to hear a typical machine script.
