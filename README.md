# Avish's Project Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository contains a collection of all the projects I've developed. Each project demonstrates my skills in various programming languages and technologies. Whether you're looking for machine learning, data analysis, or game development projects, you'll find a variety of examples here.

**I am constantly creating projects and will be updating this repository with the best ideas possible.** 💡

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Loki (Low-Key Game) 🎮
- **Description**: Loki is a game inspired by the classic *Zelda* series, developed using the Pygame library in Python. In Loki, players embark on a quest filled with adventure and challenging enemies. The name "Loki" is inspired by my cat friend, who is a constant source of motivation. 🐱💪
- **Key Python Concepts**:
  - **Module Importation**: The project utilizes external libraries such as Pygame to handle graphics, input, and game logic.
  - **Library Initialization**: Initializes libraries to set up the necessary environment for game development.
  - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Applies OOP principles to structure game entities, manage game state, and handle interactions.
  - **Function Definitions**: Uses functions to encapsulate code for different game functionalities, improving modularity and reusability.
  - **Default Parameters**: Implements default values in functions to provide flexibility and simplify code usage.
  - **Rendering Graphics and Text**: Demonstrates the use of Pygame’s rendering capabilities to display graphics and text on the screen.
  - **Event Handling**: Manages user input and game events to control game flow and interactions.
  - **Drawing and Blitting**: Utilizes methods for drawing shapes and blitting images/text onto surfaces to create the game’s visual elements.
  - **Rectangular Area Management**: Handles rectangular areas for positioning, collision detection, and layout management.
  - **Code Documentation**: Includes comments and documentation to clarify the purpose and functionality of code segments.
- **Technologies**: Pygame, Python, PyCharm
- **Features**: 
  - Classic adventure gameplay inspired by *Zelda* 🗡️
  - Challenging enemies 🐉
  - Rich visual and sound effects to enhance the experience 🎨🔊
- **Files Overview**:
  - **`main.py`**: Entry point for the game, handling game initialization and main loop.
  - **`player.py`**: Manages player character attributes and behaviors.
  - **`enemy.py`**: Defines enemy types and their interactions with the player.
  - **`settings.py`**: Contains configuration settings and constants used throughout the game.
  - **`utils.py`**: Includes utility functions and helpers for various game operations.
  - **`graphics.py`**: Handles graphical assets, including rendering and animations.
  - **`sound.py`**: Manages sound effects and background music.
  - **`levels.py`**: Defines game levels and their layouts.
  - **`debug.py`**: Provides debugging tools and displays information for troubleshooting.
